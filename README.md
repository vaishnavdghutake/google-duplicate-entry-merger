Building My First Duplicate Entry Merger Tool

My final programme accepts user search queries, fetches live product data from Google Shopping via SerpApi, cleans and organises the information, and presents comparable results—all built from scratch.

The code, for every query generates a dynamic csv file containig all the information like price, product name, seller info, in=mage url, and then sorts and merges it accordingly.

There is also an incomplete set of code that was supposed to use CLIP AI to filter duplicate images on top of what the code already does through text only but due to time constraints and less knowledge about stuff being a first year student, I was not able to complete it.
